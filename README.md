# Minicart.js

The goal of this project is to convert from paypal to stripe payment by integrating Larry Ullman's stripe blog sample.

The minicart is a great way to improve your Stripe shopping cart integration. One simple change and your users will be able to manage their shopping cart directly from your website. Additional APIs provide you the power to customize the behavior to your needs.

## Sample Setup

Currently, there is only one sample program on Apache, PHP environment.

1. Goto to https://www.stripe.com and sign up.
2. Find your public and private keys.
3. Clone the source and update keys in examples/config.inc.php.
4. Visit example/stripe.php

It's that simple! Now the minicart will appear when a user views or adds a product to their cart.

## Demo
   See http://s-stripe.webcmsc.com/

## Advanced API

The minicart has a JavaScript API for advanced users to customize the behavior.


### General

`stripe.minicart.render(config)`
Renders the minicart to the page. Config is optional and can have the following properties:

 * `parent` - HTMLElement the minicart should render to.
 * `target` - HTML target property for the checkout form.
 * `template` - HTML template for rendering. See [customization](#customization) for details.
 * `styles` - CSS styles for rendering. See [customization](#customization) for details.
 * `strings` - An object of text strings: `button`, `buttonAlt`, `subtotal` and `discount`.
 * `userInfoRequired` - When set, user will require to enter name and email during checkout.
 * `userAddrssRequired` - When set, user will require to enter address during checkout.

`stripe.minicart.reset()`
Resets the minicart back to its default state.


### View

`stripe.minicart.view.show()`
Triggers the minicart to show by adding a "minicart-showing" CSS class to the document.

`stripe.minicart.view.hide()`

## Customization

The minicart HTML template and CSS can be fully customized using two different approaches: configuration and custom themes. In both approaches, all functionality from the [API](#advanced-api) is available using [Embedded JavaScript Template](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) syntax.


### Configuration

The HTML template and CSS can be overridden using the *config* object.

```js
var myTemplate = "<div><%= config.strings.subtotal %> <%= cart.total({ format: true, showCode: true }) %></div>";

stripe.minicart.render({
    template: myTemplate
});
```

### Custom Themes

Custom themes can be created and bundled into your own custom version of the minicart.js file.

Before creating a custom theme you'll need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. Once install is complete, open a terminal window and run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install Grunt.

To create a theme follow these steps:

1. [Fork and clone this repo](https://github.com/jeffharrell/minicart/fork) so you can make your own changes. If you're not sure what this means you can find out more on [Github's Help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
2. In your new fork, create a  directory under `src/themes` with your theme name. For example, let's create `src/themes/myAwesomeTheme`.
3. Next add your HTML template into `src/themes/myAwesomeTheme/index.html`. The templates use [Embedded JavaScript Template](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) syntax for logic.
4. Finally add your CSS styles into `src/themes/myAwesomeTheme/styles.css`.
5. With all that behind you it's now time to generate your custom minicart JavaScript file. In a terminal window run `grunt build --theme=myAwesomeTheme`. This will output a bundled JavaScript file complete with the minicart and your new theme at `dist/minicart.myAwesomeTheme.js`.
6. Include this file into your HTML page instead of the normal JavaScript file and you'll see your new theme!

If you're new to the building a theme it's a good idea to copy the one at `src/themes/default` and start there.



## Localization

Localization is supported using the *strings* object.

```js
stripe.minicart.render({
    strings: {
        button: "Caisse",
        buttonAlt: "Total:",
        discount: "Reduction:"
    }
});
```

The currency symbol will be automatically updated based on the *currency_code* setting of your button.
